# oracle-apex-enhanced-datepicker

Enhance your Oracle APEX applications with a feature-rich dual-calendar **item plugin**. Seamlessly toggle between Hijri and Gregorian calendars, delivering a localized, accessible, and user-friendly date selection experience.

 ### Key Enhancements

 - 🔁 **Dual Calendar Support**  
   Switch between Hijri and Gregorian calendars effortlessly.

 - 🌐 **Language Adaptation**  
   The calendar auto-adjusts to Arabic or English based on the APEX session language.

 - 🎨 **Modernized UI**  
   Redesigned to match the **Universal Theme** of Oracle APEX for a cohesive look and feel.

 ### Date Format Rule
 - **Do not define a date format** at the item level.  
    The plugin handles formatting internally using APEX's standards.

 ### Language Detection
 - Language is determined by the `:FSP_LANGUAGE_PREFERENCE` bind variable.
 - You can modify this in the plugin source at **line 53**:
  
   ```plsql
   :FSP_LANGUAGE_PREFERENCE := 'ar-jo';
